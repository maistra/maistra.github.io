== Accessing the Grafana user interface

A route to access Grafana UI should already exist. Query OpenShift for details of the route:

```
  $ oc get routes grafana -n istio-system
  NAME      HOST/PORT                               PATH      SERVICES   PORT      TERMINATION   WILDCARD
  grafana   grafana-istio-system.127.0.0.1.nip.io             grafana    http                    None

```

Open `\http://grafana-istio-system.127.0.0.1.nip.io` in a browser. You should see Grafana's home screen, similar to this:

== Istio Mesh Metrics

Select `Istio Mesh Dashboard` from the drop-down list in the top left corner to see the mesh metrics:

Generate some traffic by accessing the Bookinfo application:

```
$ curl -o /dev/null http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage
```

The dashboard should reflect the traffic through the mesh, similarly to this:

== Istio Service Metrics

To see detailed metrics for a service click on a service name in the "Service" column. The service dashboard will look similar to this:

image::grafana-services.png[]

Note that `Tcp Bandwidth` metrics are empty, as Bookinfo uses http-based
services only. Lower down on this dashboard are metrics for workloads that
call this service (labeled `Client Workloads`) and for workloads that process
requests from the service (labeled `Service Workloads`).

You can switch to a different service or filter metrics by `client-workloads` and
`service-worloads` by using drop-down lists at the top of the dashboard.


== Istio Workload Metrics

To switch to workloads dashboard, select `Istio Workload Dashboard` from the
drop-down list in the top left corner of the screen. You should see a screen similar to this:

image::grafana-workloads.png[]

This dashboard shows workload's metrics, and metrics for client- (inbound) and
service (outbound) workloads. You can switch to a different workload to filter
metrics by inbound or outbound workloads by using drop-down lists at the top of
the dashboard.


== Cleanup

Follow the link:/docs/examples/bookinfo/#cleanup[Bookinfo cleanup instructions] to remove the application.
