== Maistra Installation Guide

This guide provides instructions for installing Maistra into an existing `OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)` or `Origin (OKD)` cluster and for creating a standalone, all-in-one origin cluster with Istio

=== Tested Configurations

- link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install/prerequisites.html[`OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 3.11`]/`Origin (OKD) 3.11`. The link:./add-redhat-registry[`Red Hat registry`] and link:./311-nodes[`nodes`] must be configured before installing.
- OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.1
- NOTE: We no longer maintain a version of `oc cluster up` for use with Service Mesh and we do not yet run within an OpenShift Online or OpenShift Dedicated environment.
