To access the private registry.redhat.io registry from OpenShift, please execute
the following:

----
$ docker login registry.redhat.io
----

This will prompt you for your Red Hat username and password. After successfully
entering your credentials, `~/.docker/config.json` will be generated with the
credentials. Copy the config.json file to the /var/lib/origin/.docker directory
on every node, creating the directory if it does not yet exist.
