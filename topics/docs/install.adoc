Guide for installing Istio into an existing OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) or Origin (OKD) cluster and for creating a standalone, all-in-one origin cluster with Istio

=== Supported Configurations

- OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 3.11 (https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install/prerequisites.html)
- Origin (OKD) 3.11
- istiooc (https://github.com/Maistra/origin/releases/tag/v3.11.0%2Bmaistra-0.8.0)
- NOTE: OpenShift Online and OpenShift Dedicated are not supported in the 0.8.0 Istio Tech Preview

=== Install Istio into Existing OCP or OKD Environment

==== Preparing the Installation

Before Istio can be installed into an existing installation it is necessary to make a number of changes to the master configuration and each of the schedulable nodes.  These changes will enable features required within Istio and also ensure Elasticsearch will function correctly.

==== Updating the Master

If manual sidecar injection (i.e. kube-inject) is used this section may be skipped.

To enable the automatic injection of the Istio sidecar we first need to modify the master configuration on each master to include support for webhooks and signing of Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs).
Then each individual Deployment requiring automatic injection needs to be modified.

First, make the following changes on each master within your installation.

- Change to the directory containing the master configuration file (e.g. /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml)
- Create a file named master-config.patch with the following contents

[source,yaml]
----
admissionConfig:
  pluginConfig:
    MutatingAdmissionWebhook:
      configuration:
        apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1
        kubeConfigFile: /dev/null
        kind: WebhookAdmission
    ValidatingAdmissionWebhook:
      configuration:
        apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1
        kubeConfigFile: /dev/null
        kind: WebhookAdmission
----

- Within the same directory issue the following commands:

```
cp -p master-config.yaml master-config.yaml.prepatch
oc ex config patch master-config.yaml.prepatch -p "$(cat master-config.patch)" > master-config.yaml
master-restart api
master-restart controllers
```

==== Updating the Nodes

In order to run the Elasticsearch application it is necessary to make a change to the kernel configuration on each node, this change will be handled through the `sysctl` service.

Make the following changes on each node within your installation

- Create a file named `/etc/sysctl.d/99-elasticsearch.conf` with the following contents:

`vm.max_map_count = 262144`

- Execute the following command:

```
sysctl vm.max_map_count=262144
```

=== Installing the Istio Operator

The Maistra installation process introduces a Kubernetes operator to manage the installation of the Istio control plane within the istio-system namespace.  This operator defines and monitors a custom resource related to the deployment, update and deletion of the Istio control plane.

The templates are available at: https://github.com/Maistra/openshift-ansible/tree/maistra-0.8/istio

The following steps will install the Maistra operator into an existing installation, these can be executed from any host with access to the cluster.  Please ensure you are logged in as a cluster admin before executing the following

[NOTE]
.OpenShift Master Public URL
=====================
The OpenShift Master Public URL should be configured to match the public URL of your OpenShift Console, this parameter is required by the Fabric8 launcher.
=====================

For community images run

```
oc new-project istio-operator
oc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/openshift-ansible/maistra-0.8/istio/istio_community_operator_template.yaml --param=OPENSHIFT_ISTIO_MASTER_PUBLIC_URL=<master public url>
```

For product images run

```
oc new-project istio-operator
oc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maistra/openshift-ansible/maistra-0.8/istio/istio_product_operator_template.yaml --param=OPENSHIFT_ISTIO_MASTER_PUBLIC_URL=<master public url>
```

=== Verifying Installation

The above instructions will create a new deployment within the istio-operator project, executing the operator responsible for managing the state of the Istio control plane through the custom resource.

To verify the operator is installed correctly, access the logs from the operator pod using the following command

```
oc logs -n istio-operator $(oc -n istio-operator get pods -l name=istio-operator --output=jsonpath={.items..metadata.name})
```

and look for output similar to the following

```
time="2018-08-14T20:00:18Z" level=info msg="Watching resource istio.openshift.com/v1alpha1, kind Installation, namespace istio-operator, resyncPeriod 0"
```

=== Deploying the Istio Control Plane

In order to deploy the Istio Control Plane we need to create a custom resource such as the one in the following example which demonstrates the configuration options supported by the operator.  The custom resource *must* be deployed into the `istio-operator` namespace and *must* be called `istio-installation`. For more information on the parameters and their configuration please see the link:../custom-install[Custom Installation Documentation].


[source,yaml]

----

The minimal custom resource required to install an Istio Control Plane is as follows,
this will deploy a control plane using the CentOS-based community Istio images.

```
apiVersion: "istio.openshift.com/v1alpha1"
kind: "Installation"
metadata:
  name: "istio-installation"
  namespace: istio-operator
```

Once you have modified the custom resource to suit your installation you can deploy the resource using the following command

```
oc create -n istio-operator -f <name of file>
```

=== Verifying the Istio Control Plane

The operator will create the `istio-system` namespace and run the installer job, this job will set up the Istio control plane using Ansible playbooks.  The progress of the installation can be followed by either watching the pods or the log output from the `openshift-ansible-istio-installer-job` pod.

To watch the progress of the pods execute the following command:

```
oc get pods -n istio-system -w
```

Once the `openshift-ansible-istio-installer-job` has completed run `oc get pods -n istio-system` and verify you have state similar to the following"

```

```

If you have also chosen to install the Fabric8 launcher you should monitor the containers within the devex project until the following state has been reached:

```
NAME                          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
configmapcontroller-1-8rr6w   1/1       Running   0          1m

launcher-frontend-2-jxjsd     1/1       Running   0          1m
```

=== Removing Istio

The following step will remove Istio from an existing installation. It can be executed from any host with access to the cluster.

```
oc delete -n istio-operator installation istio-installation
```

=== Removing Operator

In order to cleanly remove the operator execute the following:

For community images run

```
oc process -f istio_community_operator_template.yaml | oc delete -f -
```

For product images run

```
oc process -f istio_product_operator_template.yaml | oc delete -f -
```

=== Upgrading from a Pre-Existing Installation

If there is an existing, pre-0.3.0 Istio istallation then the Istio Control Plane must be removed by the associated operator prior to installing the 0.3.0 Tech Preview.  If this was not possible the installation can be removed with either of the following steps.

[NOTE]
.Removal Template
=====================
The removal template associated with the installed release must be used to remove the Istio Control Plane if it is no longer possible to remove the installation using the operator.
=====================

```
oc process -f istio_removal_template.yaml | oc create -f -
```

or

```
oc delete project istio-system
oc delete csr istio-sidecar-injector.istio-system
oc get crd  | grep istio | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc delete crd
oc get mutatingwebhookconfigurations  | grep istio | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc delete mutatingwebhookconfigurations
oc get validatingwebhookconfiguration  | grep istio | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc delete validatingwebhookconfiguration
oc get clusterroles  | grep istio | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc delete clusterroles
oc get clusterrolebindings  | grep istio | awk '{print $1}' | xargs oc delete clusterrolebindings
```

=== Instantiating a Standalone, all-in-one Origin Cluster with Istio

To create an Origin Kubernetes Distribution (OKD) cluster instance with Istio following these steps. This will deploy the CentOS-based Istio community images.

- Download istiooc from:
  https://github.com/Maistra/origin/releases. Then execute the following:
- Create a Minimum Installation Custom Resource file as described above
- Execute the following:
```
istiooc cluster up
istiooc login -u system:admin
istiooc -n istio-operator create -f cr.yaml
```
- Verify the installation was successful as described above
