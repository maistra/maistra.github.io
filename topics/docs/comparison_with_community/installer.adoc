Istio-operator is based on the Istio helm charts. Aside from embedding all installation logic into the operator (e.g. removing create-custom-resources.yaml templates), the changes made to the base Istio charts can be found below. 

## Component Modifications

### General

* GODEBUG environment variable settings have been removed from all templates.
* A `maistra-version` label has been added to all resources.
* The `istio-multi` ServiceAccount and ClusterRoleBinding have been removed, as well as the `istio-reader` ClusterRole.
* All Ingress resources have been converted to OpenShift Route resources.

### Galley
* A named `targetPort` has been added to the Galley Service.
* The Galley webhook port has been moved from 443 to 8443.
* The Galley health file has been moved to `/tmp/heath` (from `/health`)
* The `--validation-port` option has been added to the Galley.

### Sidecar Injector

* Sidecar proxy init containers have been configured as privileged, regardless of `global.proxy.privileged` setting.
* The opt-out mechanism for injection has been modified when `sidecarInjectorWebhook.enableNamespacesByDefault` is enabled.
  Namespaces now opt-out by adding an `istio.openshift.com/ignore-namespace` label to the namespace.
* A named `targetPort` has been added to the Sidecar Injector Service.
* The Sidecar Injector webhook port has been moved from 443 to 8443.

### Gateways

* A Route has been added for the istio-ingressgateway gateway.
* The istio-egressgateway gateway has been enabled by default.

### Grafana

* Has been enabled by default.
* Ingress has been enabled by default.
* A ServiceAccount has been added for Grafana.

### Tracing

* Has been enabled by default.
* Ingress has been enabled by default.
* The name for the Zipkin port name has changed to `jaeger-collector-zipkin` (from `http`)
* Jaeger uses Elasticsearch for storage.

### Kiali

* Has been enabled by default.
* Ingress has been enabled by default.
* Updates have been made to the Kiali ConfigMap.
* Updates have been made to the ClusterRole settings for Kiali.
* A demo Secret has been added that will get created using values from `kiali.dashboard.user` and `kiali.dashboard.passphrase`,
  if specified.

## Known Issues

The following are known issues that need to be addressed:

* Istio CustomResourceDefinition resources are not removed during uninstall.
* Updates have not been tested (e.g. modifying a ServiceMeshControlPlane resource to enable/disable a component).
* Uninstall is a little sloppy (i.e. resources are just deleted, and not in an intelligent fashion).
* Reconciliation is only performed on the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource (i.e. the operator is not watching installed resources,
  e.g. galley Deployment).  This means users may modify those resources and the operator will not revert them (unless
  the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource is modified).
* Rollout may hang if configuration changes made to the istio-operator deployment.  (I believe this has to do with
  leader election, where the new deployment fails to become ready until the prior one is terminated.)
