=== iptables v1.6.0: can't initialize iptables table `nat': Table does not exist (do you need to insmod?)
With the release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8, the firewall has been migrated from iptables to nftables.
The current default Maistra images are designed to on top of RHEL 8 and are no longer
compatible with iptables based systems. If the host operating system is based on
iptables instead of nftables, the proxy-init image must be set to the centos 7 version instead.

To fix this issue, add the following change to your cr.yaml and redeploy your pod.

[source,yaml]
