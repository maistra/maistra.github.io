= Mutual TLS

Apply Mutual TLS to services in the cluster.

:toc:

[IMPORTANT]
.Before Start
====
You should have only the following virtualservices and destinationrules in
the `istio-tutorial` namespace:

[source,bash]
----
$ oc -n istio-tutorial get destinationrule
$ oc -n istio-tutorial get virtualservice
----

And you should see something like the following:

----
No resources found.

[#enablemtls]
== Enabling Mutual TLS
For this example, we will take advantage of another pod that is outside of
the service mesh. Let's grab that and the customer pod in a variable.

Examine the traffic between the curl and customer services and the preference service:

{{< snippet_markdown name="curl_customer_preference" >}}

You will see something like:

=== Kiali’s Graph

Within the Kiali UI select the Graph option from the left hand navigation and
then choose:

* Namespace: istio-tutorial
* Versioned app graph
* Requests percentage
* Last 1m
* Every 10s
* Security checked under display

Notice that both requests were successful. In the Kiali graph, this can be
seen from the green line.

Now configure preference to use mutual TLS policy.

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
$ oc -n istio-tutorial create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/src/istiofiles/authentication-enable-tls.yml
----

The Policy just created can be seen below:

[source, yaml]

And try the curl again.

{{< snippet_markdown name="curl_customer_preference" >}}

And again:

----

----

This time, we can see that the curl failed with exit code 56. This is because
preference is now requiring encrypted communication over mutual TLS, but
neither customer nor curl are using it.

We can see the same thing in Kiali.

image::mtls_no_destination_rule.png[]

Now create a destination rule to make communication to customer use mutual
TLS and run the curl again.

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]

$ oc -n istio-tutorial create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/src/istiofiles/destination-rule-tls.yml

Execute the curl script:

And again:

100    62  100    62    0     0preference => recommendation v1 from '765d4bc49d-ddgg7': 117
----

This time, we can see that because customer is part of the mesh, the request
is successful. Since preference isn't, that still fails.

Looking at the Kiali graph, a lock is now present for communicationbetween
customer and preference, indicating that this communication is secured via
mTLS.

[#mtlsmigration]
== mTLS migration

Mutual TLS in OpenShift Service Mesh provides the ability to migrate to mTLS
gradually rather than forcing all services to migrate to mTLS at once. Lets
try that now.

First, delete the policy we created above.

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
$ oc delete policy -n istio-tutorial preference-mutualtls
----

Now create a policy using permissive mode.

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
$ oc -n istio-tutorial create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/src/istiofiles/policy-permissive-tls.yml
----

The contents of the file are displayed below:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "authentication.istio.io/v1alpha1"
kind: "Policy"
metadata:
  name: "preference-mutualtls"
  namespace: istio-tutorial
spec:
  targets:
  - name: preference
  peers:
  - mtls:
      mode: PERMISSIVE
----

If we try our curl commands again, we notice that this time they both pass:

{{< snippet_markdown name="curl_customer_preference" >}}

And again:

----

----

In Kiali, we can see that the lock is still shown, indicating the presence of
mTLS. We see the curl pod labeled as unknown since it's not part of the mesh,
and we can see that both customer and curl are succesful.

[#cleanup]
== Cleanup

To cleanup, delete both the policy and destination rule that we created.

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]

$ oc delete policy -n istio-tutorial preference-mutualtls
$ oc delete destinationrule -n istio-tutorial preference-destination-rule
