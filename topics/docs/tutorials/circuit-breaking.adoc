Apply circuit breaking, timeout handling, and circuit breaking

:toc:

This module will provide instruction on request retries, handling of service timeouts, and how to apply
circuit breaking. This module will also how to visualize these capabilities in Kiali.

[IMPORTANT]
.Before Start
====
You should have only the following virtualservices and destinationrules in
the `istio-tutorial` namespace:

[source,bash]
----
oc -n istio-tutorial get destinationrule
oc -n istio-tutorial get virtualservice
----

And you should see something like the following:

----
No resources found.

NAME       GATEWAYS             HOSTS   AGE
customer   [customer-gateway]   [*]     18h
----
====

[#retry]
== Retry

Instead of failing immediately, ServiceMesh will retry the Service N more
times. We will make pod recommendation-v2 fail 100% of the time. Get one of
the pod names from your system and replace on the following command
accordingly:

[source,bash]
----
oc exec -n istio-tutorial -c recommendation $(oc get pod -n istio-tutorial -l 'app=recommendation,version=v2' -o jsonpath='{..metadata.name}') -- curl -s localhost:8080/misbehave
----

You will see something like:

----
Following requests to / will return a 503
----

This is a special endpoint that will make our application return only `503`s.

You will see it works every time because ServiceMesh will retry the
recommendation service *automatically* and it will land on v1 or v3 only.

[source,bash]
----
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/scripts/curl_customer.sh)
----

You will see something like:

----
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 5290
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 5279
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 5291
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 5280
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 5292
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 5281
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 5293
----

=== Kiali's Graph

In Kiali, go to `Graph`, select the `recommendation` square, and place the
mouse over the red sign, like the picture bellow:

[#img-503]
.Kiali Graph Retry
image:retry.png[]

Note that recommendation v2 has no traffic logged, but the the client has a
100% success rate due to the retries.

Now, make the pod v2 behave well again:

[source,bash]
----
oc exec -n istio-tutorial -c recommendation $(oc get pod -n istio-tutorial -l 'app=recommendation,version=v2' -o jsonpath='{..metadata.name}') -- curl -s localhost:8080/behave
----

You will see something like:

----
Following requests to / will return 200
----

The application is back to random load-balancing between v1, v2 and v3.

[source,bash]
----
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/scripts/curl_customer.sh)
----

And again:

----
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 5282
customer => preference => recommendation v2 from '74f48f4cbc-j7rfm': 5267
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 5294
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 5283
customer => preference => recommendation v2 from '74f48f4cbc-j7rfm': 5268
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 5295
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 5284
customer => preference => recommendation v2 from '74f48f4cbc-j7rfm': 5269
----

[#timeout]
== Timeout

Now we will configure a service to wait only N seconds before giving up and
failing.

First, introduce some wait time in `recommendation v2` by making it a slow
performer with a 3 second delay by running the command

[source,bash]
----
oc exec -n istio-tutorial -c recommendation $(oc get pod -n istio-tutorial -l 'app=recommendation,version=v2' -o jsonpath='{..metadata.name}') -- curl -s http://localhost:8080/timeout?timeout=3
----

You will see something like:

----
Timeout has been set to 3 seconds
----

Hit the customer endpoint a few times, to see the load-balancing between v1,
v2 and v3 but with v2 taking a bit of time to respond

[source,bash]
----
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/scripts/curl_customer.sh)
----

[#img-timeout-v1]
.Kiali Distributed Tracing for Recommendation v1
image:timeout-v1.png[]

[#img-timeout-v2]
.Kiali Distributed Tracing for Recommendation v2
image:timeout-v2.png[]

Note the duration of v2 is 3s compared to the ms time of v1.

Then add the timeout rule. To see how this is done,
take a look at link:http://github.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/blob/master/src/istiofiles/virtual-service-recommendation-timeout.yml[virtual-service-recommendation-timeout.yml]

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: recommendation
spec:
  hosts:
  - recommendation
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: recommendation
    timeout: 1.000s
----

Note the 1s timeout for the recommendation destination.

[source,bash]
----
oc -n istio-tutorial create -f  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/src/istiofiles/virtual-service-recommendation-timeout.yml
----

You will see something like:

----
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/recommendation created
----

You will see it return v1 after waiting about 1 second. You don't see v2
anymore, because the response from v2 expires after the timeout period and it
is never returned.

[source,bash]
----
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/scripts/curl_customer.sh)
----

And then:

----
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 5304
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 5293
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 5305
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 5294
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 5306
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 5295
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 5307
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 5296
----

[#img-timeout]
.Kiali Graph for Timeout Rule
image:timeout.png[]

Note that recommendation v2 now has a 100% failure rate due to the timeout
rule.

=== Clean up

Change the implementation of `v2` back to the image that responds without the
delay of 3 seconds:

[source,bash]
----
oc exec -n istio-tutorial -c recommendation $(oc get pod -n istio-tutorial -l 'app=recommendation,version=v2' -o jsonpath='{..metadata.name}') -- curl -s http://localhost:8080/timeout?timeout=0
----

You will see something like:

----
Timeout has been set to 0 seconds
----

Then delete the virtual service created for timeout by:

[source,bash]
----
oc -n istio-tutorial delete -f  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/src/istiofiles/virtual-service-recommendation-timeout.yml
----

You will see something like:

----
virtualservice.networking.istio.io "recommendation" deleted
----

[#failfast]
== Fail Fast with Max Connections and Max Pending Requests

Let's use a 34/33/33 split of traffic.

To see how this is done, take a look at link:http://github.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/blob/master/src/istiofiles/virtual-service-recommendation-split.yml[virtual-service-recommendation-split.yml]

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]

---
----

Note the weighting of the 3 recommendation destination versions.

[source,bash]
----
oc -n istio-tutorial apply -f  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/src/istiofiles/virtual-service-recommendation-split.yml
----

You will see something like:

----
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/recommendation created
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/recommendation created
----

Let's perform a load test in our system:

[source,bash]
----
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/scripts/loadtest.sh)
----

You will see something like:

----
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 6388
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 6389
customer => preference => recommendation v2 from '74f48f4cbc-bcntc': 334
customer => preference => recommendation v2 from '74f48f4cbc-bcntc': 335
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 6390
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 6391
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 6372
customer => preference => recommendation v2 from '74f48f4cbc-bcntc': 336
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 6373
customer => preference => recommendation v2 from '74f48f4cbc-bcntc': 337
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 6374
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 6375
----

[#img-failfast]
.Kiali Distributed Tracing for Base Fail Fast
image:failfast.png[]

Note all recommendation hits are in the ms range

[#nocircuitbreaker]
=== Load test without circuit breaker

Next, introduce some wait time in `recommendation v2` by making it a slow
performer with a 3 second delay by running the command:

[source,bash]
----
oc exec -n istio-tutorial -c recommendation $(oc get pod -n istio-tutorial -l 'app=recommendation,version=v2' -o jsonpath='{..metadata.name}') -- curl -s http://localhost:8080/timeout?timeout=3
----

You will see something like:

----
Timeout has been set to 3 seconds
----

Let's perform a load test in our system. We'll have 20 concurrent requests:

[source,bash]
----
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/scripts/loadtest.sh)
----

[#img-nocicuitgraph]
.Kiali Graph Fail Fast w/no Circuit Breaking
image:nocircuit-graph.png[]

[#img-nocicuit]
.Kiali Distributed Tracing for Fail Fast w/no Circuit Breaking
image:nocircuit.png[]

All of the requests to our system were successful, but 1/3 of the requests
took longer time, as the `v2` instance/pod was a slow performer.

[#circuitbreaker]
=== Load test with circuit breaker

But suppose that in a production system this 3s delay was caused by too many
concurrent requests to the same instance/pod. We don't want multiple requests
getting queued or making the instance/pod even slower. So we'll add a circuit
breaker that will *open* whenever we have more than 1 request being handled
by any instance/pod. To see how this is done, take a look at
link:http://github.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/blob/master/src/istiofiles/destination-rule-recommendation_cb_policy_version_v2.yml[destination-rule-recommendation_cb_policy_version_v2.yml]

      trafficPolicy:
        connectionPool:

          maxEjectionPercent: 100
    - name: v3
      labels:
        version: v3
----

Note the connection pool with a max of 1 pending request and a traffic policy
where 100% of single consecutive errors fail.

[source,bash]
----
oc apply -n istio-tutorial -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/src/istiofiles/destination-rule-recommendation_cb_policy_version_v2.yml
----

You will see something like:

----
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/recommendation configured
----

Now let's see what is the behavior of the system running some load again:

[source,bash]
----
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/scripts/loadtest.sh)
----

You will see something like:

----
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/recommendation configured
----

[#img-cicuit]
.Kiali Graph Fail Fast w/Circuit Breaking
image:circuit-graph.png[]

You should see some some failures in the results. That's the circuit breaker
being opened whenever ServiceMesh detects more than 1 pending request being
handled by the instance/pod.

=== Clean up

Change the implementation of `v2` back to the image that responds without the
delay of 3 seconds:

[source,bash]
----
oc exec -n istio-tutorial -c recommendation $(oc get pod -n istio-tutorial -l 'app=recommendation,version=v2' -o jsonpath='{..metadata.name}') -- curl -s http://localhost:8080/timeout?timeout=0
----

You will see something like:

----
Timeout has been set to 0 seconds
----

Then delete the virtual service created for circuit braking by:

[source,bash]
----
oc -n istio-tutorial delete -f  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/src/istiofiles/virtual-service-recommendation-split.yml
----

You will see something like:

----
virtualservice.networking.istio.io "recommendation" deleted
----

== What we learned in this module
Service Mesh and Kiali provide the ability to configure, handle, and
visualize service retry behavior, service timeouts, and service circuit
breaking.
