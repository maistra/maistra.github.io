In this module, we are going to see how to enable authenticating end user with Service Mesh.
We will also see how to use the Service Mesh authorization feature to provide access control for services in the mesh.


[IMPORTANT]
.Before Start
====
You should have only the following virtualservices and destinationrules in
the `istio-tutorial` namespace:

[source,bash]
----
oc -n istio-tutorial get destinationrule
oc -n istio-tutorial get virtualservice
----

And you should see something like the following:

----
No resources found.

NAME       GATEWAYS             HOSTS   AGE
customer   [customer-gateway]   [*]     18h

[#enablingauthentication]
== Enabling User-End Authentication

Now it is time to enable end-user authentication.

The first thing you need to do is validate that it is possible to communicate
between all services without authentication.

[source,bash]
----
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/scripts/curl_customer.sh)
----

With output like the following:

----

customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 26
customer => preference => recommendation v2 from '74f48f4cbc-j7rfm': 27
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 27
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 27
customer => preference => recommendation v2 from '74f48f4cbc-j7rfm': 28
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 28
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 28
----

You can create the end-user authentication policy. To see how this is done,
take a look at
link:http://github.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/blob/master/src/istiofiles/policy-jwt.yaml[policy-jwt.yaml]

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: "authentication.istio.io/v1alpha1"
kind: "Policy"
metadata:
  name: "jwt-example"
spec:
  targets:
  - name: customer
  origins:
  - jwt:
      issuer: "testing@secure.istio.io"
      jwksUri: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.1/security/tools/jwt/samples/jwks.json"
  principalBinding: USE_ORIGIN
---
----

And then run the following to deploy the policy:

[source,bash]
----
oc -n istio-tutorial create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/src/istiofiles/policy-jwt.yaml
----

You will see something like:

----
policy.authentication.istio.io/jwt-example created
----

Then let's run the curl again:

[source,bash]
----
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/scripts/curl_customer.sh)
----

And you will see something like:

----
Origin authentication failed.
----

=== Kiali's Graph

Within the Kiali UI select the *Graph* option from the left hand navigation
and then choose

* Namespace: istio-tutorial
* Versioned app graph
* Requests percentage
* Last 1m
* Every 10s

[#img-auth-fail]
.Kiali Graph Authentication Failures
image::auth-fail.png[]

Note the 100% failure rate from the end-user to customer

Now the communication is not possible because the user has not been
identified (provides a valid JWT token).

To get a correct token, we need to pass the token in the http request. To see
how this is done, take a look at
link:http://github.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/blob/master/scripts/curl_customer_token.sh[curl_customer_token.sh]

[source,bash]
----
export INGRESS_GATEWAY=$(oc get route -n istio-system istio-ingressgateway -o 'jsonpath={.spec.host}')
TOKEN=$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.1/security/tools/jwt/samples/demo.jwt -s)
while :; do curl --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" $INGRESS_GATEWAY -s ; done
----

Then let's run the curl again, this time with the token.

[source,bash]
----
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/scripts/curl_customer_token.sh)
----

And you will see something like:

----
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 27103
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 27140
customer => preference => recommendation v2 from '74f48f4cbc-snwfm': 18439
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 27104
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 27141
customer => preference => recommendation v2 from '74f48f4cbc-snwfm': 18440
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 27105
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 27142
----

=== Kiali's Graph

Within the Kiali UI select the *Graph* option from the left hand navigation
and then choose

* Namespace: istio-tutorial
* Versioned app graph
* Requests percentage
* Last 1m
* Every 10s

[#img-auth-success]
.Kiali Graph Authenticated End-User
image::auth-success.png[]

Note the 100% failure rate from the authenticated end-user to customer

=== Clean Up

[source,bash]
----
oc -n istio-tutorial delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/src/istiofiles/policy-jwt.yaml
----

You will see something like:

----
policy.authentication.istio.io "jwt-example" deleted
----

== Service Mesh Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

[#enabling-rbac]
=== Enabling RBAC

The first thing to do is enable Istio Authorization by using `RbacConfig`
object. To see how this is done, take a look at
link:http://github.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/blob/master/src/istiofiles/authorization-enable-rbac.yml[authorization-enable-rbac.yml]

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: "rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1"
kind: RbacConfig
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  mode: 'ON_WITH_INCLUSION'
  inclusion:
    namespaces: ["istio-tutorial"]
----

Run this command to deploy the RBAC:

[source, bash]
----
oc -n istio-tutorial create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/src/istiofiles/authorization-enable-rbac.yml
----

You will see something like:

----
rbacconfig.rbac.istio.io/default created
----

Now RBAC is enabled on your mesh.

Then let's run the curl to test the RBAC:

[source, bash]
----
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/scripts/curl_customer.sh)
----

You will see something like:

----
RBAC: access denied
----

==== Kiali's Graph

Within the Kiali UI select the *Graph* option from the left hand navigation
and then choose

* Namespace: istio-tutorial
* Versioned app graph
* Requests percentage
* Last 1m
* Every 10s

[#img-rbac-fail]
.Kiali Graph Denied RBAC
image::rbac-fail.png[]

Note the 100% failure rate due to denied RBAC

By default, Istio uses a _deny by default_ strategy, meaning that nothing is
permitted until you explicitly define access control policy to grant access
to any service.

[#grant-access]
== Granting Access

Let's grant access to any user to any service of our mesh (`customer`,
`preference`, `recommendation`) only and only if the communication goes
through `GET` method.

To see how this is done, take a look at
link:http://github.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/blob/master/src/istiofiles/namespace-rbac-policy.yml[namespace-rbac-policy.yml]

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: "rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1"
kind: ServiceRole
metadata:
  name: service-viewer
spec:
  rules:
  - services: ["*"]
    methods: ["GET"]
    constraints:
    - key: "destination.labels[app]"
      values: ["customer", "recommendation", "preference"]
---
apiVersion: "rbac.istio.io/v1alpha1"
kind: ServiceRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: bind-service-viewer
  namespace: istio-tutorial
spec:
  subjects:
  - user: "*"
  roleRef:
    kind: ServiceRole
    name: "service-viewer"
----

Note the ServiceRole `service-viewer` is bound to the `istio-tutorial`
namespace for all users (*) and limits access to the GET method for the three
services.

Run this command to deploy the role and role binding:

[source, bash]
----
oc -n istio-tutorial create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/src/istiofiles/namespace-rbac-policy.yml
----

You will see something like:

----
servicerole.rbac.istio.io/service-viewer created
servicerolebinding.rbac.istio.io/bind-service-viewer created
----

Let's send a request now:

[source,bash]
----
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoraxe/istio-lab-summit-2019/master/scripts/curl_customer.sh)
----

You will see something like:

----
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 27224
customer => preference => recommendation v2 from '74f48f4cbc-snwfm': 18522
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 27187
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 27225
customer => preference => recommendation v2 from '74f48f4cbc-snwfm': 18523
customer => preference => recommendation v3 from '588747fd55-m8mj9': 27188
customer => preference => recommendation v1 from '7f8755bb79-vjwq2': 27226
----

The communication now is possible.

=== Kiali's Graph

Within the Kiali UI select the *Graph* option from the left hand navigation
and then choose:

* Namespace: istio-tutorial
* Versioned app graph
* Requests percentage
* Last 1m
* Every 10s

[#img-rbac-success]
.Kiali Graph Allowed RBAC
image::rbac-success.png[]

Note the 100% success rate due to allowed RBAC.
